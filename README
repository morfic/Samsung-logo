Create an image as 480x800 24bit RGB.
In gimp save as "C Header"

Edit makelogo.cpp to include this file

g++ -o makelogo makelogo.cpp

./makelogo > mybootlogo

cat start_logo.h > my_logo_rgb24_wvga_portrait.h
cat mybootlogo >> my_logo_rgb24_wvga_portrait.h
cat end_logo.h >> my_logo_rgb24_wvga_portrait.h

cp my_logo_rgb24_wvga_portrait.h ../Kernel/drivers/video/samsung/logo_rgb24_wvga_portrait.h

Compile your kernel as usual.

look at end_logo.h if you plan on replacing the charge image.

I never got to just doing it all at once, that would be on my todo list.
